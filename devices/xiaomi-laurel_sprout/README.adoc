== Device-specific note

=== `fastboot oem getlog`

This is the first device, and possibly the only device, known to ship with the
`oem getlog` fastboot command.

This is not a trivial command to use, but it is extremely useful as it allows
side-stepping the need to boot in a known working system to use the ramoops
console.

The output of the command is a jumble, but is still usable for figuring out
early boot issues. It is much better than having to rely on a booted system to
get the information, but still not as good as having a dedicated serial access.

Example usage follows.

```
 $ fastboot oem getlog 2>&1

[    0.000
(bootloader) 000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset

[    0.000000] Boot CPU: AArch64 Process
(bootloader) or [51af8014]
[...]
```

As the output of the command is on stderr, here's how to output to a file.

```
 $ fastboot oem getlog > log.txt 2>&1
```

It is unknown if there are ways to make the output better.
